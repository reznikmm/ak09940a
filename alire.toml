# Driver for AK09940A magnetic sensor.

The AK09940A driver enables the following functionalities:

- Detect the presence of the sensor.
- Perform soft reset
- Configure the sensor (operation mode, frequency, drive)
- Conduct measurements as raw 18-bit values or scaled values

The driver supports usage both with and without the Ada Driver Library,
either via generic instantiation or by instantiating tagged type object.
